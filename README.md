I applied to SUNY New Paltz, from North Rockland High School to become a Mechanical Engineering major, but I realized sophomore year I was really interested in Computer Science, so I switched majors. Therefore, I don’t have much experience coding, a little over a year, but I’m a quick learner. I have taken most of the required courses for Computer Science Chem I-II, Calc I-II, Computer science I-III, Assembly language, Object Oriented Programming, Discrete and Computer Algorithms. Discrete was probably one of the most difficult classes I’ve taken so far for my major (took it online last semester). This semester I am taking Web Programming, Cyber Security, Operating Systems, and Software Engineering. Computer Science I-II only taught students Java, so that is the code I am most confident in. Computer Science III didn’t continue Java we were taught HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so I only have about a semester of experience with those.

Web programming/development is a good skill to have in this day in age, where everyone is on the internet. It’s a very high demand skill that most companies want. When a client first looks at a website or an app, they want it to be unique and grabs their attention right way. Web programming will help improve my creative problem-solving skills, and it will allow me to learn a language that is very universal. I am not sure yet what I want to do after I graduate, I would just like to learn as much as I can before I make that decision, and web programming will help me understand different perspectives of the coding world.
